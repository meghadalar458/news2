        <p>Passengers travelling by air can now choose to wear face masks as the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on Wednesday issued an order asking airlines to announce that masks were ‘preferred’ and not mandatory on flights.</p>
        <p>“...In line with the government of India’s policy of graded approach of Covid-19 management response, the in-flight (crew) henceforth may only mention that in view of the threat posed by Covid-19, all passengers should preferably use mask/face covers,” the order read.</p>
